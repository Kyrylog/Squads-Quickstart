 * Closes Batch and the corresponding Proposal accounts for proposals in terminal states:

 *
 * WARNING: Make sure to call this instruction only after all `VaultBatchTransaction`s
 * are already closed via `vault_batch_transaction_account_close`,
 * because the latter requires existing `Batch` and `Proposal` accounts, which this instruction closes.
 * There is no on-chain check preventing you from closing the `Batch` and `Proposal` accounts
 * first, so you will end up with no way to close the corresponding `VaultBatchTransaction`s.
